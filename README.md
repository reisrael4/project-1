# Build a Responsive Website-Project 1
Using HTML and CSS I created a responsive webpage from a mock in Adobe XD, employing media queries to control visibility on multiple screen sizes. I learned a lot about overlays and opacity attempting to create a somewhat faded looking image for the background of the menu section. The menu section from start to finish was the most challenging as it contained the most content and involved several nested grids. Adobe XD proved extremely helpful, particularly in identifying colors and fonts within the mock. Overall I am very happy with how the project turned out, the responsiveness behaved as expected and it looks as I intended.
